				<p>Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination. Everything I've 
					talked about today, the examples I've given, they all have deadlines. And when 
					there's deadlines, the effects of procrastination are contained to the short 
					term because the Panic Monster gets involved. But there's a second kind of 
					procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline. So if you 
					wanted a career where you're a self-starter -- something in the arts, something 
					entrepreneurial -- there's no deadlines on those things at first, because 
					nothing's happening, not until you've gone out and done the hard work to get 
					momentum, get things going. There's also all kinds of important things outside 
					of your career that don't involve any deadlines, like seeing your family or 
					exercising and taking care of your health, working on your relationship or getting 
					out of a relationship that isn't working. </p>
				<p>Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things is the Panic 
					Monster, that's a problem, because in all of these non-deadline situations, the 
					Panic Monster doesn't show up. He has nothing to wake up for, so the effects of 
					procrastination, they're not contained; they just extend outward forever. And it's 
					this long-term kind of procrastination that's much less visible and much less talked 
					about than the funnier, short-term deadline-based kind. It's usually suffered quietly 
					and privately. And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness, 
					and regrets. And I thought, that's why those people are emailing, and that's why 
					they're in such a bad place. It's not that they're cramming for some project. It's 
					that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator, at times, in 
					their own lives. The frustration is not that they couldn't achieve their dreams; 
					it's that they weren't even able to start chasing them. .</p>
